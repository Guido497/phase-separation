In this folder you can find:
- a Jupyter Notebook that has all the code in there required to predict your sequences of interest
- A file called 'finalized_RF.sav' which is the Random Forest model pretrained on the human proteome
- a file called 'RF_original_input_data.pbz2' which contains the original dataframe for the human proteome used to train the RF model

To start predicting your own sequences you should:
 1) download the 'finalized_RF.sav' and the 'RF_original_input_data.pbz2' file
 2) Place these in a directory where you can load them into the Jupyter Notebook
 3) Prepare a list of sequences that you want to have predicted in fasta format (for example tr|proteinID|name) and 
    save these in a directory in fasta (.fa) format. 
 4) Go through the workbook by executing one cell by another from top to bottom. It will also clearly state when and where you should load which file
 5) Output the predictions as a .csv file. The final csv will have 216 prediction column, which you can just average to get the final
    'phase separation likelihood score'.
