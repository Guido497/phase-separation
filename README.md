# phase-separation

Find here the code associated with the PSAP classifier. Currently the code contains several paths which will have to be adapted for each user.
In addition, an output folder will have to be specified where the input file for the downstream processing
and machine learning is located. Here it is specified as df.to_pickle('out\\human_llps.pkl'). 

In the near future the PSAP classifier will be updated into a command line tool. More information on this can be found
on this page soon!
