Find here the code associated with the PSAP classifier and some of the figures in te manuscript.

If you are interested in performing training on a dataset and predicting your own sequences, go to the folder 
'quick_usage_for_prediction' in which you find the required workbooks and instructions as to how to do this. 

If you just want to predict your own sequences using a pretrained model, then it is the fastest to go to the folder
'predict_using_pretrained_model' and follow the steps outlined there.
