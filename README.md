# phase-separation

The code contains several paths which will have to be adapted for each user. An example
of such a path is C:\\guido\\Vermeulen lab\\students\\Jurriaan\\software\\fasta\\uniprot_reviewed_9606_140119.fasta". 

In addition, an output folder will have to be specified where the input file for the downstream processing
and machine learning is located. Here it is specified as df.to_pickle('out\\human_llps.pkl').
