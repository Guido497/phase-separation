# In this directory you can find 3 workbooks that are required for creating a proteome input file
# and perform training of a random forest model with 10x cross validation. 

Workbook 1: This requires as input a fasta file for the proteome of interest, downloaded from UniProt. Ideally this is the human
proteome, as for human the most proteins are known that are able to undergo phase separation in vitro and in vivo. 
While originally intended to study phase separation, this approach can in principle be adapted to any specific class of proteins
of interest that can be sufficiently distinguished from other proteins based on the aminoacid content. 

Workbook 2: This workbook uses the .pkl file saved in Workbook 1. 
Here the 'labels' are added for the group of proteins that provide the training group (i.e. the positive controls). 

Workbook 3: This workbook uses the .pkl file saved in Workbook 2. First as random forest model is trained and eveluated using ROC and PRC metrics. Next, 
you can read in a second proteome file (here read in to 'second_df'). This second proteome can be any fasta file of any
number of proteins, as long as it has been processed as well through workbook 1 and 2. Note that for this second proteome
file you should still add the labels in workbook 2, but this has no effect on the predictions.
